# Diabetes Prediction & Analysis 📊

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning models and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a healthcare dataset.

## 🔍 Features:
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers using Z-score analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Statistical summaries
  - Density plots
  - Scatter plots & box plots to visualize feature relationships
  - Correlation matrix to understand dependencies
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
- **Performance Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC Score
  - Model comparison through visualization

## 📊 How to Use:
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Update the `file_path` variable in `main.py` to your dataset location.
3. Run `main.py` to process data, visualize trends, and train models.
4. View performance metrics and classification reports.

## 🚀 Technologies Used:
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy
